### Useful Info :

1. Options for getting data from external sources:

   - UI scraping
   - RSS feeds
   - Public APIs
   - Private APIs

2. UI scraping is generally inefficient and should be the last resort due to issues like potential bans and detection by websites.

3. RSS feeds are the fastest way to obtain data, offering information in an easily processable XML format.

4. Public APIs are provided by companies with documentation on how to make requests and retrieve data. They may require keys or OAuth for access, and they can be free or paid.

5. Private APIs are not meant for public use but can be discovered by examining how a company's front-end interacts with its back-end. Accessing them may require some advanced knowledge of the internet.

6. The recommended approach is to first check for RSS feeds when accessing data from a website before considering public APIs, private APIs, or UI scraping.
